We may see a slight increase in easterly winds but it is unlikely they will get strong enough to move enough snow to elevate the avalanche danger. It's been 16 days since we measured any precipitation and conditions are generally stable. However, there is a very small chance you may encounter isolated pockets of unstable snow in steep terrain. Even though the danger is low, it is still important to maintain safe travel protocol like traveling one at a time in steep terrain and watching partners from safe spots outside of avalanche runout zones.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Glide Avalanches:&nbsp;</strong>We've seen a lot of glide cracks reappear over the past two weeks, and have recorded a few glide avalanches releasing. These are large and unpredictable, so the only way to manage the problem is to avoid traveling below open glide cracks.</p>
<p><strong>Cornices&nbsp;</strong>are another constant hazard. They can release naturally, or they can fail under the weight of a person. Your best bet is to avoid spending time below large cornices and to give them plenty of space if you are traveling along ridgelines.</p>"

These tend to be most concerning on steep sunny slopes later in the day as the surface crust melts. These avalanches have the potential to step down to a deeper buried weak layer 4 to 6' deep and cause a much larger avalanche. On northern aspects at upper elevations, where dry snow still exists, smaller wind slab avalanches could also be a concern.</p>
<p><strong>FRIDAY AVALANCHE OUTLOOK:&nbsp;</strong>Conditions tomorrow look very similar to today. The biggest differences are the potential for less cloud cover and stronger winds, which could make wet avalanches more likely and make fresh wind slabs at upper elevations more likely.&nbsp;</p>

Warm temperatures will increase the chance of wet loose avalanches. You can test for these on small test slopes and assume they will be more consequential on steeper ones.

Choosing slopes that do not have terrain traps on them is a safer option if you get into avalanche terrain.</p>
<p><strong>WEDNESDAY AVALANCHE OUTLOOK: </strong>As the clouds move out and temperatures rise the potential for wet avalanches will also increase. These include wet loose and glide avalanches. If it feels warm then seeking shady slopes will be the safest option.

Avalanche danger will start out MODERATE and may rise to CONSIDERABLE if the sun heats the snowpack more than anticipated. After so much recent avalanche activity due to large storms, an assessment mindset is a good approach today. Lingering wind slabs up to 3' deep should be on the stubborn side, but could be triggered by a person especially in steep upper elevation terrain. If the sun comes out before new storm clouds move in, wet avalanches will be quick to fail in steep terrain. A fresh glide avalanche released on Tincan yesterday so continue to keep an eye out for glide cracks and avoid traveling in their path.&nbsp; The Valentine's Day buried surface hoar is buried so deep it is becoming unlikely a person could trigger an avalanche on this layer.</p>

Last are the glide avalanches that keep releasing. <strong>Travel in avalanche terrain is NOT recommended.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>MONDAY'S AVALANCHE OUTLOOK </strong>- There will be no avalanche forecast tomorrow. The storm over the region today looks to move out Monday morning decreasing the chances of natural avalanches.

There were at least 15 new glide avalanches observed yesterday in the Turnagain Pass zone (including Girdwood), which makes this the most concerning problem today. These avalanches are very dangerous and it's best to avoid being underneath any glide crack right now. Wet loose avalanches are occurring naturally and are growing in size with each passing warm day and more dangerous wet slabs are becoming possible. As surface crusts break down, or where they don't exist, a person could also trigger a large avalanche on a layer of buried surface hoar that is 2 to 3' deep in Turnagain Pass. There is a lot of uncertainty with the timing of dangerous conditions and these problems can be avoided by choosing low angle slopes.&nbsp;</p>",NULL

It will be easier to trigger an avalanche on slopes that do not have a supportable crust. The safest option is to avoid traveling on or above steep slopes. We are in the middle of a glide cycle where many glide cracks are opening and releasing as large glide avalanches. Try to avoid spending time under glide cracks. Finally, wet loose avalanches are releasing on sunny slopes and wind slabs around a foot deep may be easy to trigger today on slopes exposed to the wind.&nbsp;</p>",NULL

The only way to completely avoid this problem is to stick to low angle slopes with nothing steep above. Warm temperatures this week caused an increase in glide avalanches and wet loose avalanches. Debris from these slides is running below treeline in places like Girdwood and Seward.

This layer is now buried 2-3' deep and remains our primary concern. The only way to avoid this problem is by sticking to low angle slopes and avoiding steeper terrain overhead. Surface snow issues including wind slabs up to 1' deep and sun-triggered avalanches within the new snow are also a concern today.</p>

Easterly ridgetop winds increased overnight creating fresh wind slabs up to 1' deep in the upper elevations. The bigger concern with the wind slabs is that they are located in the same place and could trigger the deeper and more dangerous weak layer causing a larger avalanche. These problems can be avoided by choosing terrain that is less than 30 degrees and not connected to anything steeper.</p>

Sticking to lower angle slopes, with nothing steeper above you, is a great way to enjoy the snow without worry.</p>

Elevated ridgetop easterly winds on Monday created blowing snow and <strong>wind slabs</strong> in Turnagain Pass and Summit Lake. These are 2 days old by now and should be stabilizing, but keep an eye out for stiff snow over softer snow especially in the upper elevations. Stubborn wind slabs aren't as likely to give a warning sign like a shooting crack so watch for hazards in the runout below in case an unlikely avalanche occurs. The sun is having an effect on the snow in several ways. First, with warm temperatures, sun, and calm wind we could see natural <strong>loose avalanches</strong> especially near rocks on steep south facing slopes. Second,&nbsp;<strong>c</strong><strong>ornice falls</strong> could occur naturally or be triggered by a human or machine especially in the heat of the afternoon. Last, the sun has been heating up the south facing slopes and a thin sun crust is present in many areas. This last effect isn't much of a problem right now, but may start to affect the riding conditions and become a layer for an avalanche to slide on with a new load of snow especially since it has surface hoar sitting on top of it in many places.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another fresh <strong>glide avalanche</strong> was observed yesterday above Johnson Lake, which is in the Bench Peak area on the north border of the Summit Lake zone.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">We're expecting another day of quiet weather today before we see a slight increase in winds starting tonight. With no major weather on the way and no avalanche activity in the past eight days, all signs are pointing to generally stable conditions. It is very unlikely a person will trigger an avalanche today, but we can never rule out that possibility entirely. If you are taking advantage of this spell of good weather and stable conditions to get into steep terrain, there are a few things you can keep in mind to improve your odds of recovering from an unlikely avalanche encounter today:</p>
<ul style=""text-align: left;"">
<li>Only expose one person at a time in steep terrain, and keep an eye on partners from safe locations outside of runout zones. Think about what it actually means to be in a safe spot; it often means staying farther away from overhead terrain than one would expect.</li>
<li>Play the what-if game before getting into steep terrain. Do you have an escape route off the slope if you are the unlucky one to trigger a small avalanche? If you are watching your partner, are you close enough to get to them in a reasonable amount of time if they need help?</li>
<li>Be aware of overhead hazards like&nbsp;<strong>cornices&nbsp;</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>glide cracks.</strong> Both are present across our advisory area, and both can release unexpectedly. If you're traveling along ridgelines, give cornices plenty of room since they often break further back than we'd expect.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We've had a great stretch of weather and stability, but don't let yourself get lulled into complacency. Conditions may be generally stable across a broad area, but there is always some variability that we can't account for. Safe travel protocol can help you recover if your group is the unlucky one to find that unlikely pocket.</p>

If you have to travel underneath a glide crack, expose one person at a time and move quickly past them. As people push into steeper terrain look out for isolated wind slabs that may feel stiff and produce shooting cracks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's not too late to catch us on our brewery tour this week. The Girdwood Brewery is hosting us tomorrow for a conversation about the world of snow and avalanches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forecaster Chat -&nbsp;<strong>Thursday, February 6th, 6-7:30 p.m.&nbsp;</strong>at Girdwood Brewing Co. in Girdwood. Andrew Schauer will discuss recent CNFAC research and highlight ways it can help your backcountry game. Details&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.cnfaic.org/event/cnfac-forecaster-chat-new-tools-for-the-kit-how-recent-cnfac-research-can-help-your-backcountry-game/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">HERE</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The winds picked up a bit yesterday likely making a new batch of small wind slabs. More about this below. Otherwise, it has been nearly five days of amazing weather that has contributed to generally stable snowpack conditions in Turnagain Pass. That being said, the snowpack in Crow Creek and Johnson Pass/Silvertip area may not be as stable and warrant a bit of caution should you find yourself in these zones. Slopes affected by the sun and warm temperatures may have a thin sun crust on the surface today that may not melt. Look out for&nbsp;<strong>dry loose</strong> ""sluff' avalanches on steep slopes shaded from the sun if you are looking to avoid sun effected slopes.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Wind Slab Avalanches</strong>: Lingering wind slabs from yesterday's winds will likely be small and harder to trigger today. The bigger concern would be if a wind slab carries a human into rocks or off a cliff. Keep this in mind especially if you plan on getting into the alpine today. Terrain features with hollow sounding snow and shooting cracks are clues you have found a wind slab.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Glide Avalanches:</strong> Glide cracks are showing themselves again in Turnagain Pass and in Summit Lake with the most recent glide avalanche occurring on February 4 south of Turnagain Pass. Try to avoid spending time under them or consider another objective where this hazard does not exist.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Cornices:</strong> Cornice falls are less likely today but could be a concern if someone wanders on to one. Give them a lot of room when you are traveling on ridges.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Safe Travel:</strong> Remember your training. When recreating in the mountains unexpected things happen especially when we let our guard down. Low avalanches does not mean no avalanches. Good travel protocol such as spacing out and exposing one person at a time on steep slopes on the way down is the safest way to move in the backcountry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Recent Avalanches:</strong> Glide activity is making a slow comeback with one reported two days ago at the south end of Turnagain Pass and glide cracks spotted in Summit Lake. The inversion over the past few days and sunny weather was responsible for small loose wet avalanches at higher elevations on steep solar slopes. About a week ago there was a human triggered wind slab avalanche in Lynx Creek.&nbsp;</p>"

It shouldn't be enough to move a lot of snow around so the chances of a human triggering an avalanche remain unlikely.&nbsp; The sun is forecast to shine again today. Watch for rollerballs on south facing slopes to know that a human could trigger a small ""sluff"" or loose avalanche and give cornices some space. Although it is unlikely, a small new wind slab or an old stubborn one in steep upper elevation terrain should stay on our radar. A new glide avalanche occurred yesterday. Watch for large cracks and wrinkles in the snow and avoid traveling under them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's not too late to catch us on our brewery tour this week. The Girdwood Brewery is hosting us tomorrow for a conversation about the world of snow and avalanches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forecaster Chat -&nbsp;<strong>Thursday, February 6th, 6-7:30 p.m.&nbsp;</strong>at Girdwood Brewing Co. in Girdwood. Andrew Schauer will discuss recent CNFAC research and highlight ways it can help your backcountry game.

</ul>","<p>With a northwest breeze and the inversion breaking down, it should stay a little cooler today so we may not see as much <strong>sun effect </strong>as the last several days. There may be a crust today on those slopes that got baked in the sun the last few days that may not soften in todays conditions depending on the wind and temperatures. The wind isn't expected to be enough to create <strong>wind slabs</strong> large enough to become a problem, but keep an eye out for changing conditions especially in the afternoon when the wind is forecast to increase the most. Blowing snow indicates a slab could be forming where it is being deposited.&nbsp; Fresh wind slabs will often give feedback like a shooting crack to let us know they need more time to stabilize.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Recent Avalanches: </strong>Yesterday, a new glide avalanche was spotted on the southern end of Turnagain Pass northwest of Peak 4,940'. Saturday through Monday, while the inversion was in place and temperatures were above freezine in the upper elevations, there were reports of small wet loose avalanches or ""sluffs"" being triggered naturally. One larger sluff was observed on Monday as it was occurring in the <a href=""../../../observations/#/view/observations/06e9754b-530c-46df-98c3-39c64553f971"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">20 Mile drainage</a> (video below). Almost a week ago now there was a human triggered wind slab in <a href=""https://www.cnfaic.org/observations/#/view/observations/e3aa574f-0735-4a65-9721-6fcc079af125"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Lynx Creek</a> last Friday. On Monday, John and Andrew investigated the very large avalanche that occurred in Ragged Bowl on January 25. Check out that video below and a report will be available soon.</p>
<p><strong>Cornices:&nbsp;</strong>Temperatures in the upper elevations are cooling this morning so conditions aren't as ripe for a cornice fall as they have been the last few days, but giving them some room on the ridge and watching them while passing underneath is still a good plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Glide avalanches: </strong>With another new glide avalanche yesterday we are keeping a close eye on the glide situation. Glide cracks are popping up across zones (we haven't noticed any in Seward, but maybe we just haven't seen them?). They are difficult to see from below so try to get a view of the route from afar especially if the plan is to climb something steep. Choose an up route that gives any glide crack plenty of space as they could fail at any time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Safe Travel: </strong>We practice companion rescue once a month at the avalanche center to help us feel more confident that we can recover if we get caught in an avalanche (this happens to avalanche professionals more often than you would expect). Consider adding this to your travel plan, if it isn't there already, that includes safe up routes and watching your partners.&nbsp;</p>"

Accidents still occur on LOW danger days and there are several things to watch out for today. More sunshine is forecast and an inversion is making upper elevation temperatures abnormally warm. This makes both cornice fall and wet loose avalanches ""sluffs"" more likely today. There could also be an old stubborn windslab that a human could trigger in upper elevation steep terrain.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>","<p>This period of calm weather is giving us a chance to get out and enjoy the snow that has accumulated and created a strong snowpack (with the exception of the Crow Creek area) from the stormy winter. The Crow Creek area has a thinner snowpack than the rest of Turnagain Pass and additional caution is warranted there. Here are some more details on the hazards and things to think about while we take advantage of this weather window.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Recent Avalanches: </strong>We've gotten reports the last few days of small wet loose avalanches or ""sluffs"" being triggered naturally by the sun and warm temperatures heating the rocks on south facing slopes. One larger sluff was observed as it was occurring in the <a href=""../../../observations/#/view/observations/06e9754b-530c-46df-98c3-39c64553f971"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">20 Mile drainage</a> yesterday (video below). These are the first avalanches we are aware of since the human triggered wind slab in <a href=""https://www.cnfaic.org/observations/#/view/observations/e3aa574f-0735-4a65-9721-6fcc079af125"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Lynx Creek</a> on Friday. John and Andrew investigated the very large avalanche that occurred in Ragged Bowl on January 25. Check out that video below and a report will be available soon.</p>
<p><strong>Lingering Wind Slabs:</strong> We don't expect a person could trigger a wind slab today, but a stubborn one could surprise us. Watch for stiffer snow over softer snow under a ridgeline or in a cross loaded gully (see example below on Pete's North). The strong winds last week came from many directions so these could be found on any aspect.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cornices: </strong>Temperatures remained warm overnight in the upper elevations. This, combined with the forecast sun today, will make higher chances for a natural or human triggered cornice fall. These are unlikley to trigger an avalanche below, but there is evidence of recent cornice fall in this zone and the chunks are big enough to do some damage if they hit us from above.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sun effect:</strong> Many small ""sluffs"" were observed in Bertha Creek yesterday on the south facing slopes. There are good chances this will happen again today and there may be a sun crust on these slopes as well. There is plenty of winter left, but it is time to add the sun to the list of how the weather changes the snowpack.</p>
<p><strong>Glide avalanches:&nbsp;</strong>New glide cracks are being noticed daily in Turnagain Pass and Summit Lake. It seems they were encouraged to wake up by the combination of the last big storm followed by a cold spell. The only one to release recently, that we know of, was sometime last week on the south end of Seattle Ridge. Two days ago, a group was surprised to find themselves climbing up over a glide crack that they hadn't been able to see due to the steep slope. Avoid spending time under them if you can, the next one could release at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Safe Travel: </strong>Sticking with safe systems, even during periods of low danger, will reduce our chances of getting into trouble if we get surprised by something today. This includes making a travel plan with multiple options depending on what we find out there, checking our transceivers, airbags, communications, and other rescue gear before heading up, and traveling one at a time in avalanche terrain.&nbsp;</p>"
160903,2025-02-03 15:23:23,2025-02-03 15:58:53,2025-02-03 16:00:00,2025-02-04 16:00:00,Wendy Wagner,forecast,1,1,1,"<p>With another day of quiet weather, triggering an avalanche in the Turnagain Pass area remains unlikely. However, even at times of LOW danger avalanches can still occur. These could be triggering a small wind slab in steep terrain, triggering a cornice fall while traveling along a ridgeline, or the sun might trigger small sluffs on steep southerly rocky terrain that warms this afternoon.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>","<p>What a brilliant weekend with sunshine and warm temperatures in the upper elevations. Parking lots at Turnagain Pass were at full capacity and no reports of avalanches. Today, and even tomorrow, should be equally nice. As folks continue to get into the bigger and steeper terrain, there are several things to be sure and consider. First, the snowpack in the Crow Creek area of Girdwood and the Johnson Pass/Silvertip area between Turnagain Pass and Summit Lake are suspect for harboring buried weak layers. These areas are on the periphery of the forecast zone and warrant extra caution and snowpack assessment. Second, anytime snow is on the mountains there is always some degree of avalanche hazard. Here is rundown:</p>
<p><strong>Lingering Wind Slabs:</strong> Various wind slabs are scattered about from the strong northwest outflow winds last week. As always, keep a lookout for where winds have drifted snow and loading slopes. Signs of cracking in the snow around you and stiffer snow over softer snow are clues you've found a wind slab. These can be highly consequential in steep rocky terrain.</p>
<p><strong>Cornices: </strong>As anyone that has been out in the mountains after January&rsquo;s stormy weather knows, the cornices are big. We can&rsquo;t stress enough how important it is to give these an extra wide berth. They could be easier to trigger as warm temperatures are now being seen above 2,000&rsquo; and sunshine will add to this warmth during the midday hours. They are notorious for breaking back further than expected and it&rsquo;s also a good idea to limit time under them.</p>
<p><strong>Sluffing in the heat of the day:</strong> It's that time of year the sun is starting to heat up the rocky terrain facing south. With such warm ambient temperatures in the Alpine currently, the sun can tip the balance in the afternoon. One group noted sun triggered sluffs in Tincan's Library yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>Glide avalanches:&nbsp;</strong>Glide cracks are continuing to ooze open throughout the forecast areas. We are only aware of one that has released so far (south end of Seattle Ridge), but more cracks are appearing every day. These avalanches are very large and unpredictable. The best way to manage this problem is to avoid spending time under open glide cracks.</p>
<p><strong>Safe Travel: </strong>As always, pay attention to the conditions in the area where you are traveling, and adjust objectives if you notice any surprising signs like shooting cracks or collapsing. You can minimize the consequences of finding an unlucky pocket of unstable snow by sticking with safe travel protocols. This includes traveling one at a time in steep terrain, watching partners from safe locations, and carrying appropriate rescue gear so you can recover if things go wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Avalanches: </strong>There were no avalanches reported over the weekend. The last known avalanches were on Friday when a skier triggered a wind slab in <a href=""https://www.cnfaic.org/accidents/east-groundhog-peak/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">steep terrain in the Lynx Creek drainage</a> and a snowmachiner triggered a small slab on Seattle Ridge.&nbsp;</p>"

You may still find isolated pockets of reactive snow in some steep wind-loaded terrain, but those chances are slim as another quiet day of weather is on the way. Even though conditions are generally stable, it is still important to follow safe travel protocols like traveling one at a time in steep terrain and watching partners from safe areas outside of runout zones.</p>

</ul>","<p><strong>Recent Avalanches:&nbsp;</strong>On Friday a skier triggered an avalanche on a steep, wind-loaded terrain feature in the Lynx Creek drainage. The skier was caught and carried, sustained serious injuries and was evacuated by the Air National Guard. We have posted a full report on the incident and the response <a href=""https://www.cnfaic.org/accidents/east-groundhog-peak/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">here</a>. Thank you to the parties involved for sharing the information and photos. We're wishing the injured skier a quick recovery.</p>
<p>After several days of quiet weather and no major layers of concern in the Turnagain Pass zone, it is unlikely that a person will trigger an avalanche today. That is a broad statement for a large area, so be careful how you use that information. A few things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is always a small chance of finding pockets of unstable snow, especially in steep alpine terrain. This was the case with the recent avalanche incident on Friday, and although chances of finding something similar today are small, they are never zero.</li>
<li>The snowpack in the Crow Creek area on the northwest corner of the Turnagain forecast zone may be more similar to the Summit Lake snowpack than the rest of the Turnagain Pass zone. If you travel in that area, it will be important to be a little more careful with snowpack assessment and terrain management.</li>
<li>The snowpack from Johnson Pass to Silvertip Creek is a transitional zone between the generally stable Turnagain Pass snowpack and the potentially problematic Summit Lake setup. Similarly to Crow Creek, this area warrants a little more caution than the core of the Turnagain Pass zone.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Avalanche accidents happen even when the danger is low. As always, pay attention to the conditions in the area where you are traveling, and adjust objectives if you notice any surprising signs like shooting cracks or collapsing. You can minimize the consequences of finding an unlucky pocket of unstable snow by sticking with safe travel protocols. This includes traveling one at a time in steep terrain, watching partners from safe locations, and carrying appropriate rescue gear so you can recover if things go wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Cornices: </strong>There are many large cornices that will begin to heat up during the temperature inversion that is settling in this week. These often catch people by surprise, breaking back much further from the edge than we'd expect. Keep that in mind if you are traveling along ridgelines, and be sure to limit spending time under them since they can release naturally.</p>
<p><strong>Glide avalanches:&nbsp;</strong>Glide cracks continue to pop open throughout our forecast areas. We are only aware of one that has released so far, but more are appearing every day. These avalanches are very large and unpredictable. The best way to manage this problem is to avoid spending time under open glide cracks.</p>"

These are slowly becoming more stubborn and less likely to trigger, but with two human-triggered avalanches yesterday these are still an issue to pay attention to. Look for better stability and surface conditions in terrain that has remained sheltered from recent winds, still holding soft snow on the surface.</p>

A cautious approach to avalanche terrain today that includes testing the snow on small inconsequential slopes is a good way to see how this new snow is stabilizing. It is becoming more unlikely that a person would be able to trigger a very large avalanche on a weak layer buried 4 to 6' deep.

Triggering a large slab avalanche, up to several feet deep and hundreds of feet wide, on any aspect above 1,000' is the main concern.

These cracks and avalanches are littering the popular slopes in this zone. Look for a ""brown frown"" on the slope and avoid spending any time underneath if possible.

This problem can be avoided by choosing not to travel under these ""brown"" cracks or exposing one person at a time if you must move past them. There is also a small chance of triggering a stubborn wind slab in steep terrain.&nbsp;</p>",NULL

Continuing to look for and avoid spending any time under these dark cracks is recommended. Otherwise, the snowpack is generally stable and triggering an avalanche is unlikely. The exception would be triggering a small slab in steep rocky terrain.&nbsp;</p>",NULL

These avalanches are large, destructive, and unpredictable. The only way to manage this problem is to avoid traveling below open glide cracks whenever possible. The passing storm system may bring a trace to an inch of snow to our area, which is not expected to change the avalanche conditions.</p>",NULL

This kind of avalanche is completely unpredictable, not triggered by people, and highly destructive. It is important to look for and avoid spending time under glide cracks.

These are very big avalanches that release spontaneously, so it is important to avoid spending any time under open glide cracks.
